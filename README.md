# Analyzing Factors Influencing Football Player Performance

## üìã Brief Description and Context

This project focuses on identifying and analyzing the key factors that impact the performance of professional football players. Using a dataset containing detailed performance metrics, player attributes, and game statistics, we built a series of machine learning models to uncover significant patterns and make predictions. 

The objective was to enable stakeholders, such as coaches and analysts, to understand the factors driving performance, helping them make data-driven decisions for team optimization and player development.

The project involved:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering to prepare the dataset.
- Implementing various machine learning models, including **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest Regressor**, and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, to evaluate player performance.
- Performing Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify the most impactful attributes.
